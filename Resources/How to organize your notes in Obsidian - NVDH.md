## Notes

﻿00:23﻿

when you're deciding where to put notes what it really boils down to is how do you want to find this note again there are a few methods for that

﻿00:35﻿

first is folders folders are probably the one that we're most familiar with because regardless of your operating system this is how your computer lets you choose where to store files

﻿00:51﻿

problem with folders is that you can't put one file into different folders it it's one or the other so it forces you to make a decision as to where that note belongs

﻿01:07﻿

I think that folders are best for situations where one note really only belongs in a single folder or if you're trying to maintain the uniqueness of a note

﻿02:22﻿

I think the links are best for connecting two nodes that have similar meanings and more of a semantic Connection

﻿03:18﻿

I use tags for system related things like when two notes don't necessarily have any connection semantically but I still want to process them in a certain way

﻿03:50﻿

metadata are good for combinations of the previous three folders links and tags or when you're trying to visualize your body of knowledge that's in your Vault it's also great for creating databases

﻿04:26﻿

latch is sort of like an approach for how you can find your data and the kind of things that you should put in your note to begin with so that you can find them later

﻿04:41﻿

latch stands for five things location alphabet time category and hierarchy

﻿04:53﻿

location responds to the physical place where a note was created

﻿07:03﻿

a in latch stands for alphabet and this just means that you can also find a note by knowing its file name or by knowing the first parts of its file name

﻿09:02﻿

T stands for time and in obsidian I keep track of the time component of my notes using links or metadata with the help of some plugins

﻿11:16﻿

C stands for category so this could mean many things I use links and metadata for semantic connections or similarities and meaning and then I use tags for system related things

﻿11:33﻿

of content or mocs this is my Moc for tabletop role-playing games and Moz is just a page that summarizes other pages that are related to it so in this case these are all the nodes that are related to tabletop role-playing games so I have

﻿11:29﻿

for semantic categories I mostly create maps of content or mocs this is my Moc for tabletop role-playing games and Moz is just a page that summarizes other pages that are related to it

﻿12:35﻿

the other way that I mentioned is tags if I go to tags here you'll see that I have a bunch of tags

﻿12:49﻿

the last part of latch is H which is hierarchy that means that if you're looking for a note but you don't know what it's called then you could try to go further up the chain and look to see what its parents notes are
