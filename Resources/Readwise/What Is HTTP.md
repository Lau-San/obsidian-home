> An HTTP request is the way Internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website.

> Each HTTP request made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information. A typical HTTP request contains:
> 1. HTTP version type
> 2. a URL
> 3. an HTTP method
> 4. HTTP request headers
> 5. Optional HTTP body.

> An HTTP method, sometimes referred to as an HTTP verb, indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from the queried server. For example, two of the most common HTTP methods are ‘GET’ and ‘POST’; a ‘GET’ request expects information back in return (usually in the form of a website), while a ‘POST’ request typically indicates that the client is submitting information to the web server

> HTTP headers contain text information stored in key-value pairs, and they are included in every HTTP request (and response, more on that later). These headers communicate core information

> The body of a request is the part that contains the ‘body’ of information the request is transferring. The body of an HTTP request contains any information being submitted to the web server, such as a username and password, or any other data entered into a form.

> An HTTP response is what web clients (often browsers) receive from an Internet server in answer to an HTTP request.

> A typical HTTP response contains:
> 1. an HTTP status code
> 2. HTTP response headers
> 3. optional HTTP body


> [!quote] [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvb3czkn72ffw4b2n4qa8dz)
> HTTP status codes are 3-digit codes most often used to indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. Status codes are broken into the following 5 blocks:
> 1. 1xx Informational
> 2. 2xx Success
> 3. 3xx Redirection
> 4. 4xx Client Error
> 5. 5xx Server Error
> The “xx” refers to different numbers between 00 and 99.

> Much like an HTTP request, an HTTP response comes with headers that convey important information

> What is in an HTTP response body?
> Successful HTTP responses to ‘GET’ requests generally have a body which contains the requested information.
