> The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the internet or controls who can connect to it. Instead, thousands of different organizations operate their own networks and negotiate voluntary interconnection agreements.

> **The last mile** is the part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses to the internet.

> **Data centers** are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content. Some are owned by large companies such as Google and Facebook. Others are commercial facilities that provide service to many smaller websites.

> **The backbone** consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — that carry data between data centers and consumers.

> The internet began as [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), an academic research network that was funded by the military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA)

> In 1973, software engineers [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) and [Bob Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn) began work on the next generation of networking standards for the ARPANET. These standards, known as [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), became the foundation of the modern internet. ARPANET switched to using TCP/IP on January 1, 1983.

> No one runs the internet. It’s organized as a decentralized network of networks. Thousands of companies, universities, governments, and other entities operate their own networks and exchange traffic with each other based on voluntary interconnection agreements.

> The shared technical standards that make the internet work are managed by an organization called the [Internet Engineering Task Force.](http://www.ietf.org/)

> The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (ICANN) is sometimes described as being responsible for internet governance. As its name implies, ICANN is in charge of distributing domain names (like vox.com) and [IP addresses](http://www.vox.com/cards/the-internet/whats-an-ip-address). But ICANN doesn’t control who can connect to the internet or what kind of information can be sent over it.

> Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to identify each other on the internet.

> An ICANN department known as the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/) is responsible for distributing IP addresses to ensure that two different organizations don’t use the same address.


> [!quote] [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvcmkpkfmypqdzgz4g50669)
> The current internet standard, known as IPv4, only allows for about 4 billion IP addresses. This was considered a very big number in the 1970s, but today, the supply of IPv4 addresses is nearly exhausted.
> So internet engineers have developed a new standard called [IPv6.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) IPv6 allows for a mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the exact figure is [39 digits long](http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/05/26/the-number-of-possible-ipv6-addresses-read-out-loud/) — ensuring that the world will never again run out.

> A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the internet. Splitting information up into small, digestible pieces allows the network’s capacity to be used more efficiently.


> [!quote] [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvcqwz3pfagegexjdegq9a7)
> A packet has two parts. The [header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Header) contains information that helps the packet get to its destination, including the length of the packet, its source and destination, and a checksum value that helps the recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit. After the header comes the actual data. A packet can contain up to 64 kilobytes of data, which is roughly 20 pages of plain text.

> The web was created by [Timothy Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), a computer programmer at the European scientific research organization [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/), in 1991.

> The web supported hyperlinks, allowing users to browse from one document to another with a single click.

> Over time, the web became increasingly sophisticated, supporting images, audio, video, and interactive content.


> [!quote] [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmvcw47xxmq3qn9p3zatygpy)
> In 1994, Berners-Lee created the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/) (W3C) to be the web’s official standards organization. He is still the W3C’s director and continues to oversee the development of web standards. However, the web is an open platform, and the W3C can’t compel anyone to adopt its recommendations

> The web has become so popular that many people now regard it as synonymous with the internet itself. But technically, the web is just one of many internet applications.

> A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download and view websites.

> SSL, short for Secure Sockets Layer, is a family of encryption technologies that allows web users to protect the privacy of information they transmit over the internet.

> When you visit a secure website such as Gmail.com, you'll see a lock next to the URL, indicating that your communications with the site are encrypted. Here's what that looks like in Google's Chrome browser:

> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the reason you can access Vox by typing vox.com into your browser rather than a hard-to-remember numeric address such as 216.146.46.10.
