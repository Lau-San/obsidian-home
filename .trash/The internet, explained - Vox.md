## Notes

- The internet is the world’s most popular computer network.

- the web is just one of many internet applications

- The last mile is the part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses to the internet.

- The last mile also includes the towers that allow people to access the internet with their cell phones.

- Data centers are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content.

- Data centers have very fast internet connections, allowing them to serve many users simultaneously.

- Data centers can be located anywhere in the world, but they are often located in remote areas where land and electricity are cheap.

- The backbone consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — that carry data between data centers and consumers.

- Backbone providers frequently connect their networks together at internet exchange points

- The internet began as ARPANET, an academic research network that was funded by the military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA).

- In 1973, software engineers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn began work on the next generation of networking standards for the ARPANET.

- These standards, known as TCP/IP, became the foundation of the modern internet.

- No one runs the internet. It’s organized as a decentralized network of networks.

- The shared technical standards that make the internet work are managed by an organization called the Internet Engineering Task Force.

- The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is sometimes described as being responsible for internet governance. As its name implies, ICANN is in charge of distributing domain names (like vox.com) and IP addresses. But ICANN doesn’t control who can connect to the internet or what kind of information can be sent over it.

- Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to identify each other on the internet.

- An ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is responsible for distributing IP addresses

- The current internet standard, known as IPv4, only allows for about 4 billion IP addresses.

- the supply of IPv4 addresses is nearly exhausted.

- IPv6 allows for a mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the exact figure is 39 digits long — ensuring that the world will never again run out.

- There are two basic types of wireless internet access: wifi and cellular.

- Anyone can purchase wifi networking equipment in order to provide internet access in a home or business.

- Cellular networks are more centralized. They work by breaking up the service territory into cells.

- Each cell has a tower at its center providing services to devices there.

- By storing files on servers and delivering software over the internet, cloud computing provides users with a simpler, more reliable computing experience.

- A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the internet.

- A packet has two parts. The header contains information that helps the packet get to its destination

- After the header comes the actual data.

- A web browser is a computer program that allows users to download and view websites.
