## Location

Responds to the physical place hwre the note is created, or the place the note is related to.

## Alphabet

If you know the letters that are in the title ofyour note, you can find them by sorting your notes alphabetically or even better, using a search tool.

## Time

You can use time to find notes that were created at a specific point in time. You can also take into account modification times, scheduling, etc.

## Category

This could mean different things depending on the notes. You can use tags or metadata to specify categories. 

## Hierarchy

You can organize your notes in a hierarchical way. This could be via metadata or a [[MOC]], which is a map of content; a note used to map to other related (child) notes.
