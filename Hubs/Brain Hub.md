# Brain Hub

This is the place where everything in my second brain converges.

## Personal Knowledge Management

### My Process

My process for taking notes and building my second brain is as follows:

1. I save resources that may have information relevant to me.
2. I read/watch a resource, taking notes or highlighting parts that I deem important.
3. I process my notes and highlights into my knowledge base.

#### Capturing

> [!note]
> Temporarily I will be testing Readwise Reader for this phase.

- [Raindrop.io](https://app.raindrop.io/my/29194577) - Here, I save web textual material for highlighing. After I've read a resource and highlighted it I copy the highlights into a resource in Obsidian, ready to be processed.
- Zotero - This is a desktop application that lets me save PDFs and other text files. I use this, since Raindrop.io doesn't allow for highlighting PDFs.
- [ReClipped](https://reclipped.com/u/104969606177165114856/snippets?q=tag:annotate-me) - Lets me annotate video content.

#### Processing

- [[Resources]] - This is a Hub for my resource notes. Everythinf from the Capturing phase ends up here. From here I process them into my Knowledge Base.
